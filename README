GN forked from Chromium src.git at 556eead9ce1e.

src/test/test.* forked from Ninja https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.

base/ to be removed over time.

Build with:
  ./build/build.py
  out/gn_unittests  (or out\gn_unittests.exe)

Binary in out/gn  (or out\gn.exe)

If you have a Chromium tree handy, checkout 556eead9ce1e, then use:

  ./build/full_test.py /path/to/cr out/lin/gn
  
where `out/lin/gn` is the relative path in the Chromium tree to the gn binary.
This will see if any .ninja files have changed between the original GN, as well
as do some simple performance testing.
